# **[App Name] - Genetic and Image-Based Prediction Platform**

## **Overview**

**[App Name]** is an innovative web-based platform that allows users to upload genetic data or an image of a person's face to receive predictions about their appearance, behavior, ancestry, and potential health risks. The application is built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js**: v12.x or later
- **Python**: v3.7 or later
- **Docker**: v19.x or later
- **Git**: v2.x or later
- **AWS Account** (optional for cloud deployment)

### **Installation**

Clone the repository and navigate to the desired service directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

Install dependencies for each service:

```bash
cd user-interface-service
npm install

cd ../auth-service
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Repeat for other services
```

### **Running the Services**

1. **Start Docker**: Ensure Docker is running on your machine.
2. **Start Services**:

   - For each service, use Docker Compose to build and run the containers:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the User Interface Service.
   - The API Gateway will route requests to the appropriate backend services.
